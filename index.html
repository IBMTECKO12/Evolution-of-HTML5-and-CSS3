    <h2 id="intro">Evolution of HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>HTML, invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993, evolved from HTML 2.0 (1995) standardizing basics like forms and images, to HTML 3.2 (1997) enhancing design, HTML 4.01 (1999) integrating CSS and accessibility, and HTML 5.1 (2016) adding semantics and media. CSS began with CSS1 (1996) for separating style from content, CSS2 (1998) introducing positioning, CSS2.1 (2011) fixing issues, and CSS3 modularizing advanced features like animations.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of HTML from HTML2.0 to HTML5</h2>
            <img src="./images/History_Evolution_HTML.webp" alt="HTML Evolution Timeline">
            <p><b>HTML 2.0 (Released November 1995 by IETF):</b> This was the initial formal specification that standardized HTML as the web evolved. It expanded upon previous informal versions by incorporating fundamental structural elements. Significant additions include &ltforms&gt, &lttables&gt, &ltimages&gt, and &lthyperlinks&gt. No significant tags were deprecated, as this version was foundational. It outlined essential functions like text formatting and lists that all browsers maintained until the introduction of later versions. Browser support: Universal in current browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.</p>
            <p><b>HTML 3.2 (Released January 1997 by W3C):</b> Created solely by W3C after the closure of IETF's group, this version aimed for backward compatibility while introducing features for improved design. New features include enhanced tables with attributes for borders and alignment, applets (for Java), text wrapping around images, superscripts/subscripts, and math elements (although support was limited). Some experimental tags from drafts were deprecated, such as &ltmulticol&gt, &ltspacer&gt, &ltnobr&gt. This release focused on multimedia integration. Browser support: Fully functional in all modern browsers, although applets are now outdated.</p>
            <p><b>HTML 4.01 (Released December 1999 by W3C):</b> This was a minor revision of HTML 4.0 (1997), correcting mistakes and clarifying guidelines. It moved towards separating content from presentation (promoting CSS). New features included improved accessibility (e.g. for abbreviations), scripting support, frames, and enhanced forms. It deprecated presentational tags like &ltfont&gt, &ltbasefont&gt, &ltcenter&gt, &ltu&gt, &lts&gt, &ltstrike&gt, &ltdir&gt, &ltmenu&gt, &ltisindex&gt, &ltapplet&gt (which should be replaced with CSS). It also introduced  for multimedia purposes. This version was the standard in the early 2000s. Browser support: Widely accepted, though the use of frames is not recommended.</p>
            <p><b>HTML 5.1 (Released November 2016 by W3C):</b> This is an update to HTML5 (2014) that concentrates on modern web applications. It introduced semantic elements for improved structure and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). New multimedia tags include &ltaudio&gt, &ltsource&gt, &ltembed&gt, &lttrack&gt and &ltvideo&gt. &ltcanvas&gt and &ltsvg&gt for graphics. Forms received enhancements with input types (email, date). Deprecated tags include &ltacronym&gt, &ltapplet&gt, &ltbasefont&gt, &ltbig&gt, &ltblink&gt, &ltmarquee&gt, &ltcenter&gt, &ltdir&gt, &ltfont&gt, &ltframe&gt, &ltframeset&gt, &ltnoframes&gt, &ltisindex&gt, &ltlisting&gt, &ltxmp&gt, &ltplaintext&gt, &ltstrike&gt, &lts&gt, &lttt&gt, and many more (which should be replaced with CSS or  instead); has been removed. The focus was on mobile/responsive design. Browser support: Excellent across all major browsers.</p>

            <p>As illustrated in the table above, HTML has evolved dramatically to meet the web's growing demands for interactivity, accessibility, and multimedia. From HTML 2.0's foundational standardization of core tags like &ltforms&gt and &ltimages&gt in 1995, to HTML 3.2's enhancements for design and applets in 1997 (while dropping unsupported experiments like math formulas), the language progressed toward better structure. HTML 4.01 in 1999 emphasized CSS separation by deprecating presentational tags such as &ltfont&gt and &ltcenter&gt, adding features for scripting and global support. By HTML 5.1 in 2016, semantic elements (&ltheader&gt, &ltnav&gt) and media tags (&ltvideo&gt, &ltaudio&gt) were introduced, deprecating relics like &ltapplet&gt, &ltbig&gt, and &ltacronym&gt to focus on mobile apps and clean code, all with excellent modern browser compatibility. This progression reflects a shift from simple documents to dynamic experiences. &copy; <em>EJIWUNMI SHEHU LAWAL 2025</em></p>

            <h2>The Evolution of CSS</h2>
            <img src="./images/CSS-Released-year.png" alt="CSS Evolution Timeline">
            <p><b>CSS1 (Released December 1996 by W3C):</b> The first official specification aimed at separating style from content. It included fundamental features such as font properties (font-family, size, weight), text styling (color, alignment, decoration), margins, padding, borders, and basic selectors (tags, classes). Advanced layouts were not included. Its focus was on visual styling for HTML. Browser support: Core features available in all browsers. </p>
            <p><b>CSS2 (Released May 1998 by W3C):</b> Built upon CSS1 by introducing advanced layout capabilities. New features included positioning (absolute, relative, fixed), z-index for layering, media types (@media for print/screen), aural styles (for speech), paged media, and improved selectors (pseudo-classes like :hover). Refinements to the box model were also included. Browser support: Most features became standard, though some aural features were deprecated. </p>
            <p><b>CSS2.1 (Recommended in 2011 by W3C):</b> A revision of CSS2 aimed at correcting errors, eliminating poorly supported features (e.g., certain aural styles, system colors), and clarifying rules. No significant new features were added, but interoperability was enhanced. It effectively served as the standard for many years. Browser support: Fully implemented.</p>
            <p><b>CSS3 (Ongoing since the 2000s, Modular by W3C):</b> Rather than a single version, it encompasses modules that allow for incremental development. Key additions/modules include advanced selectors (:nth-child), backgrounds/borders (gradients, shadows, rounded corners), transitions/animations (@keyframes), flexbox/grid layouts, multi-column layouts, and responsive design (@media queries). It deprecated some CSS2 features, including specific pseudo-element syntax. Browser support: Varies by module, but core elements are supported in modern browsers.</p>

            <p>As illustrated in the table above, CSS has transformed from a basic styling tool to a modular powerhouse for modern web design. CSS1 in 1996 introduced fundamental properties like fonts, colors, and backgrounds to decouple presentation from HTML structure, with no major deprecations as it laid the groundwork. CSS2 in 1998 expanded with positioning, pseudo-classes (:hover), and media queries, though some features like aural styles were later refined or removed for practicality. CSS2.1 in 2011 focused on stability by fixing inconsistencies and dropping poorly supported elements, ensuring broad browser adoption. CSS3, evolving modularly since the 2000s, added advanced capabilities such as flexbox, grid layouts, transitions, and responsive designs, deprecating outdated syntax while prioritizing flexibility, all with strong support in contemporary browsers. This evolution underscores CSS's role in enabling consistent, interactive, and device-agnostic web experiences. &copy; <em>EJIWUNMI SHEHU LAWAL 2025</em></p>

            <h2>Explanation of HTML Tags and CSS Used in my Assignment</h2>
            <p>In this assignment, I used a range of HTML tags to structure the content and conform to W3C standards. For example, &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declares the document type, purpose: to ensure modern rendering mode, no attributes needed, supported by all browsers. &lt;html&gt; is the root element, lang attribute for language, universal support.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;head&gt;: Contains metadata, purpose: organize non-visible info like title and links, supported everywhere.</li>
                <li>&lt;body&gt;: Main content container, purpose: hold visible page elements, attributes like id for anchoring, full browser support.</li>
                <li>&lt;title&gt;: Sets page title, purpose: display in browser tab, no attributes, universal.</li>
                <li>&lt;p&gt;: Paragraphs, purpose: block text, attributes like class for styling, supported by all.</li>
                <li>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;: Headings, purpose: hierarchical structure, id for anchors, all browsers.</li>
                <li>&lt;strong&gt;: Bold text, purpose: emphasis, no attributes, supported.</li>
                <li>&lt;em&gt;: Italic emphasis, purpose: stress, universal.</li>
                <li>&lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, &lt;caption&gt;: Data tables, purpose: organized info, attributes like width in %, full support.</li>
                <li>&lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;: Lists, purpose: ordered/unordered items, type attributes, supported.</li>
                <li>&lt;img&gt;: Images, purpose: embed visuals, src/alt attributes, universal.</li>
                <li>&lt;a&gt;: Links, purpose: hyperlinks, href/target attributes, all browsers.</li>
                <li>&lt;link&gt;: External resources like CSS, purpose: connect styles, href/rel, supported.</li>
                <li>&lt;meta&gt;: Metadata, purpose: charset/description, name/content attributes, all.</li>
                <li>Special entities: &amp;copy; for copyright, &amp;reg; registered, &amp;trade; trademark, &amp;amp; ampersand, &amp;euro; euro, &amp;nbsp; space, &amp;lt; less than, &amp;gt; greater than&mdash;purpose: display reserved chars, no attributes, universal support.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For CSS, I used selectors like tags (body), classes (.float-left), IDs (#html-section). Properties include font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; text-align: left; color: black/white; background-color: grey/DarkSlateBlue/white; float: left/right; border: 2px solid black; list-style-type: square; units like % for tables, px for fonts; pseudo-elements a:link {color: white/black}, a:hover {color: blue for nav}, a:active, a:visited {color: grey}; padding/margin as needed. All supported in modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge.</p>
            <p>This research has me fired up; I've grown as a coder just by learning this history!</p>
